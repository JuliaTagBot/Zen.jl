## Supported features

1. Ordinary function calls.
2. Broadcasting
3. `getproperty` for structs.

## Not supported feaures

1. Keyword parameters: Cassette doesn't support them, not sure how to overcome it.
2. Functions with varargs: looks feasible, but it's of low priority right now.
3. Constructors: require custom pass, maybe worth to implement it inside Cassette itself.
